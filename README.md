As a part of practice project, i tried to build some sort of portfolio with flask-HTML-CSS-Bootstrap. 
The intention and focus of the project is to learn Flask framework in practical way by creating real project.
pages created by raw HTML and Bootstrap. smtplib for mail handling which i might change it later for better performance.
File structure is very simple and straigh forward.
The project is stll under development. 
Static folder is empty i havent done much CSS. I tried to use different file structure but it might be not the best way.
I used pythonanywhere.com to host the site and you can check the online version at:
