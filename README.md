As a part of a practice project, I tried to build some sort of portfolio with flask-HTML-CSS-Bootstrap. 
The intention and focus of the project is to learn Flask framework in a practical way by creating a real project.
pages created by raw HTML and Bootstrap. smtplib for mail handling which i might change it later for better performance.
The file structure is very simple and straight forward.
The project is stll under development. 
The static folder is empty i haven't done much CSS. I tried to use a different file structures but it might be not the best way.
I used pythonanywhere.com to host the site and you can check the online version at:
